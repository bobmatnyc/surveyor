# Survey Platform Fix Verification

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Fixed Survey Selection Issue
- **Problem**: David Goodman's survey was showing instead of demo survey
- **Solution**: Disabled private surveys by setting `ENABLE_PRIVATE_SURVEYS=false` in `.env.local`
- **Result**: Demo survey "Technology Assessment Demo Survey" now displays by default

### 2. ✅ Fixed Organization Form Navigation Issue  
- **Problem**: Clicking "Next" button after entering organization ID did nothing
- **Solution**: 
  - Wrapped form fields in proper `<form>` element
  - Added `onSubmit` handler to form
  - Changed button type to "submit"
  - Added form validation and error handling
  - Added loading state and better user feedback
- **Result**: Form now properly submits and navigates to survey

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Demo Survey Display
- **Problem**: Need to showcase all question types properly
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed QuestionType enum imports in static-surveys.ts
  - Ensured demo survey contains all question types:
    - Likert 5-point scale
    - Likert 3-point scale  
    - Multiple choice (multi-select)
    - Single select
    - Text input
    - Number input
    - Boolean (yes/no)
- **Result**: Demo survey now properly showcases all available question types

### 4. ✅ Improved Survey State Management
- **Problem**: Inconsistent state management between old and new store
- **Solution**:
  - Updated survey-interface.tsx to use SimpleSurveyStore
  - Fixed state synchronization issues
  - Added proper error handling and logging
- **Result**: Survey state properly maintained throughout the flow
