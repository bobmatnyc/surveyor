# CSP (Content Security Policy) Fix Summary

## Problem
The Next.js application was encountering CSP errors with the message:
```
"Refused to evaluate a string as JavaScript because 'unsafe-eval' is not an allowed source of script"
```

This error was preventing the application from working properly in development mode, as Next.js requires `unsafe-eval` for hot reloading and React refresh functionality.

## Root Cause
The CSP configuration was not environment-aware and was using production-level security settings in development mode, which blocked Next.js development features.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `next.config.js`
- Made CSP configuration environment-aware
- Added `unsafe-eval` permission for development mode only
- Production mode maintains strict CSP without `unsafe-eval`

### 2. Enhanced `middleware.ts`
- Updated CSP generation to be environment-aware
- Added WebSocket support (`ws:`, `wss:`) for development hot reloading
- Maintained proper nonce-based CSP security
- Added import for new security utility function

### 3. Improved `lib/security.ts`
- Added new `generateCSP()` utility function
- Environment-aware CSP generation with proper development/production modes
- Added support for API-specific CSP policies
- Maintained security standards while enabling development features

### 4. Created Test Suite
- `scripts/test-csp.js` - Tests current CSP configuration
- `scripts/test-production-csp.ts` - Validates production vs development CSP policies
- Comprehensive validation of CSP headers and security settings

## Key Changes Made

### Development Mode CSP
```javascript
script-src 'self' 'nonce-{nonce}' 'unsafe-eval' 'strict-dynamic'
connect-src 'self' ws: wss:
```

### Production Mode CSP
```javascript
script-src 'self' 'nonce-{nonce}' 'strict-dynamic'
connect-src 'self'
```

### API Endpoints CSP
- Development: Allows `unsafe-eval` for debugging
- Production: Highly restrictive `default-src 'none'`

## Features Maintained
- ✅ Nonce-based CSP security
- ✅ Hot reloading in development
- ✅ React refresh functionality
- ✅ Proper security in production
- ✅ Environment-aware configuration
- ✅ WebSocket connections for development

## Testing Results
- All CSP tests passed
- Application loads without CSP errors
- Hot reloading works correctly
- PM2 process running stable
- Production CSP maintains security standards

## Files Modified
1. `/next.config.js` - Environment-aware CSP configuration
2. `/middleware.ts` - Enhanced CSP generation with environment detection
3. `/lib/security.ts` - New CSP utility function and environment support
4. `/scripts/test-csp.js` - CSP validation script
5. `/scripts/test-production-csp.ts` - Production CSP test suite

## Verification
The fix has been verified by:
- Running the application without CSP errors
- Confirming hot reloading functionality works
- Testing both development and production CSP configurations
- Validating proper nonce generation and usage
- Ensuring PM2 process stability

The CSP configuration now properly supports Next.js development mode while maintaining production security standards.
