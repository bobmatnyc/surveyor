# Task: Fix stakeholder selection stuck state bug

## Description
Users get stuck on 'Please select your stakeholder role first' with no resolution path - critical survey taking issue

## Root Cause
The `EnhancedSurveyQuestions` component was not receiving the `stakeholder` prop from `SurveyInterface`, causing it to show the error message even when stakeholder was selected.

## Fix Implemented
1. Updated `EnhancedSurveyQuestions` interface to include `stakeholder` and `expertise` props
2. Modified `SurveyInterface` to pass `stakeholder` and `expertise` props to `EnhancedSurveyQuestions`
3. Added fallback logic to use props when store values are not available
4. Added useEffect to sync store with props on component mount

## Files Modified
- `/components/survey/enhanced-survey-questions.tsx`
- `/components/survey/survey-interface.tsx`

## Test Results
✅ Build successful with no TypeScript errors
✅ Stakeholder selection flow now properly passes data to survey questions component
