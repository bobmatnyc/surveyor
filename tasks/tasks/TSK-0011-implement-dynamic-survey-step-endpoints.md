# Task: Implement dynamic survey step endpoints

## Description
Create /api/survey/{surveyId}/step/{stepId} endpoints with stakeholder-specific content

## Steps
1. Create Next.js route handler at /app/api/survey/[surveyId]/step/[stepId]/route.ts
2. Implement GET handler with stakeholder-specific content filtering
3. Add proper error handling and validation
4. Use existing API types and test fixtures
5. Implement response caching for performance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [✅] Next.js route handler created with proper file structure
- [✅] GET /api/survey/{surveyId}/step/{stepId} endpoint functional
- [✅] Stakeholder-specific content filtering implemented
- [✅] Error handling for invalid surveyId/stepId
- [✅] Response validation using existing TypeScript interfaces
- [✅] Integration with existing survey data structure
- [✅] Performance optimization with response caching

## Completion Notes
✅ **COMPLETED** - Dynamic survey step endpoints fully implemented
- Next.js route handler created at /app/api/survey/[surveyId]/step/[stepId]/route.ts
- Full GET endpoint functionality with stakeholder filtering
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Integration with existing survey data architecture
- Performance optimizations with response caching implemented

## Notes
**Phase 2 API Implementation - ACTIVATED**

Foundation work complete:
✅ API schema designed with TypeScript interfaces
✅ Test survey packages created
✅ Unit test framework implemented
✅ Mock server setup ready

Ready for immediate implementation using established patterns and existing data structures.
