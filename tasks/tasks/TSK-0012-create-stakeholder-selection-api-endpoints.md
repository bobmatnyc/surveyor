# Task: Create stakeholder selection API endpoints

## Description
Implement /api/survey/{surveyId}/stakeholders and /api/survey/{surveyId}/stakeholder/{stakeholderId} endpoints

## Steps
1. Create /app/api/survey/[surveyId]/stakeholders/route.ts for stakeholder list
2. Create /app/api/survey/[surveyId]/stakeholder/[stakeholderId]/route.ts for individual stakeholder
3. Implement GET handlers for both endpoints
4. Add validation for surveyId and stakeholderId parameters
5. Integrate with existing survey data structure
6. Follow established API schema patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [✅] Stakeholder list endpoint GET /api/survey/{surveyId}/stakeholders implemented
- [✅] Individual stakeholder endpoint GET /api/survey/{surveyId}/stakeholder/{stakeholderId} implemented
- [✅] Proper Next.js route file structure created
- [✅] Parameter validation for surveyId and stakeholderId
- [✅] Integration with existing survey data architecture
- [✅] Response follows established JSON schema
- [✅] Error handling for invalid IDs
- [✅] Stakeholder filtering and data transformation

## Completion Notes
✅ **COMPLETED** - Stakeholder selection API endpoints fully implemented
- Stakeholder list endpoint at /app/api/survey/[surveyId]/stakeholders/route.ts
- Individual stakeholder endpoint at /app/api/survey/[surveyId]/stakeholder/[stakeholderId]/route.ts
- Complete parameter validation and error handling
- Full integration with existing survey data architecture
- JSON schema compliance with established patterns

## Notes
**Phase 2 API Implementation - ACTIVATED**

Foundation work complete:
✅ API schema designed with stakeholder endpoints
✅ Test survey packages include stakeholder data
✅ TypeScript interfaces ready for implementation
✅ Mock server configured for testing

Ready for immediate parallel execution with TSK-0011.
