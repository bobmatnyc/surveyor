- **Layout**: Centered with max-width containers
- **Cards**: White/80 with backdrop-blur, shadow-xl, ring-1 ring-blue-100/50
- **Typography**: Clean hierarchy with proper spacing
- **Interactive elements**: Hover effects and selected states

### 2. Survey Questions Page

- Progress indicator card at bottom matching first page style

### 3. Survey Complete Page
