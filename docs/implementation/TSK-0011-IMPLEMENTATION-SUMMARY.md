### 🚀 Technical Implementation

#### Architecture
- RESTful API design following established patterns
- Consistent response format across all endpoints
- Type-safe implementations with TypeScript
- Integration with existing survey data architecture

#### Data Flow
1. Client requests survey metadata
2. Client selects stakeholder
3. Client requests first step (filtered for stakeholder)
4. Client submits step responses with validation
5. Client tracks progress through survey
6. Client completes survey with final validation

#### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient question filtering by stakeholder
- Optimized step navigation calculations
- Caching headers to prevent unnecessary requests
- Lightweight error responses

#### Type Safety
- Complete TypeScript interfaces for all API types
- Type guards for response validation
- Compile-time type checking
- Runtime type validation

### 🧪 Testing Implementation

#### Unit Tests
- Individual endpoint testing
- Mock data manager integration
- Error scenario validation
- Response format verification

#### Integration Tests
- Complete survey flow testing
- Multi-step navigation testing
- Stakeholder filtering validation
- Error handling across endpoints

#### API Client Tests
- TypeScript client functionality
- Network error handling
- Response parsing validation
- Type safety verification

### 📊 Test Results

```
✓ Survey API Client (9 tests) - 4ms
  ✓ getSurveyMetadata should return survey metadata for valid survey
  ✓ getSurveyMetadata should handle API errors
  ✓ getStakeholders should return stakeholders list
  ✓ getSurveyStep should return survey step with questions
  ✓ getSurveyStep should construct URL with query parameters
  ✓ submitSurveyStep should submit step responses
  ✓ getSurveyProgress should return progress information
