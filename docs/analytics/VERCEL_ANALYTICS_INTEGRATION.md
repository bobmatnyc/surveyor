# Vercel Analytics Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the integration of Vercel Analytics into the surveyor platform to track user interactions and performance metrics.

## Implementation Details

### Package Installation
- **Package**: `@vercel/analytics@^1.5.0`
- **Installation**: `npm install @vercel/analytics`

### Integration Location
- **File**: `/app/layout.tsx`
- **Component**: `<Analytics />` from `@vercel/analytics/react`
- **Placement**: Added before the closing `</body>` tag in the root layout

### Configuration
The Analytics component is configured with default settings:
- **Automatic tracking**: Page views, route changes, and user interactions
- **Environment compatibility**: Works in both development and production
- **Performance tracking**: Core Web Vitals and custom metrics

### Code Implementation
```typescript
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react';

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {/* App content */}
        <Analytics />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Features Tracked

### Automatic Tracking
- Page views and route changes
- User interactions (clicks, form submissions)
- Core Web Vitals (CLS, FID, LCP, FCP, TTFB)
- Custom performance metrics

### Benefits
- **Real-time insights**: Track user behavior and performance
- **No configuration required**: Works out of the box
- **Privacy-focused**: GDPR and CCPA compliant
- **Lightweight**: Minimal impact on bundle size

## Testing and Verification

### Integration Status
- ✅ Package installed successfully (`@vercel/analytics@^1.5.0`)
- ✅ Component imported and placed correctly in layout
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ Build process completes without errors
- ✅ Development server starts successfully
- ✅ Analytics test page created for verification

### Test Page
A dedicated test page has been created at `/analytics-test` to verify the integration:
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3001/analytics-test` (development)
- **Features**: 
  - Automatic tracking verification
  - Custom event testing buttons
  - Integration status display
  - Real-time event tracking demonstration

### Custom Event Tracking
Example of custom event tracking implementation:
```typescript
import { track } from '@vercel/analytics';

// Track custom events
track('survey_started', {
  page: 'survey',
  stakeholder: 'manager',
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
});

track('survey_completed', {
  page: 'survey',
  completion_time: 120, // seconds
  questions_answered: 15
});
```

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Vercel to enable analytics dashboard
2. Configure custom events if needed
3. Set up alerts for performance thresholds
4. Monitor analytics dashboard for insights

## Notes
- Analytics will only collect data when deployed to Vercel
- Local development shows placeholder data
- No additional environment variables required
- Compatible with existing security headers and CSP policies
